# Study Notes Registry Smart Contract

## Description of the Project

The Study Notes Registry is a blockchain-based decentralized application built on the Aptos network that allows students, researchers, and educators to securely store and manage their study notes on-chain. This smart contract provides a permanent, tamper-proof repository for educational content, ensuring that valuable knowledge and research materials are preserved forever on the blockchain.

The contract implements a simple yet effective system where users can:
- Create their own personal notes registry
- Add study notes with title, content, author information, and timestamp
- Maintain a permanent record of their educational journey
- Access their notes anytime with guaranteed availability and immutability

Each user maintains their own collection of study notes, with automatic registry creation when adding the first note. The system tracks metadata including authorship and timestamps, providing a complete audit trail for academic work.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to revolutionize the way educational content is stored, shared, and preserved by leveraging blockchain technology. We aim to create a global, decentralized knowledge repository where:

- **Academic Integrity**: Every note is permanently recorded with authorship and timestamp, preventing plagiarism and ensuring proper attribution
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Educational content is preserved forever, immune to server failures, company shutdowns, or data loss
- **Universal Access**: Students worldwide can access a decentralized platform that doesn't rely on traditional centralized services
- **Transparency**: All educational contributions are publicly verifiable, promoting accountability in academic work
- **Democratization of Education**: Breaking down barriers to knowledge storage and sharing, especially in regions with limited infrastructure

We envision a future where blockchain-based educational tools become the standard for academic institutions, creating a trustless environment for knowledge management and collaboration.

## Future Scope of the Project
